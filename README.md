# FastSeg
A new app project for fast and efficient medical image annotation.


## How to use

  1. Upload the folder with the images you want to annotate in the assets folder of this project.
  2. Make sure to change the .gitignore accordingly to avoid uploading files on the server!
  3. Change the pubspec.yaml file and add the link to your new folder there:
    - assets:
      - assets/ExampleFolder/
  4. If needed change the classCategoryList in 'src/functionality/categories.dart' to be compatible with your categories.


<img src="assets/demo.PNG"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
